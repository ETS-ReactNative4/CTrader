Today, climate change is becoming a global challenge. As a solution, leading countries are focusing on the climate neutrality concept to overcome climate change effects. Greenhouse gases are the main source of global warming, and they lead to climate change. Carbon neutrality means having a zero carbon footprint by balancing emissions with equal reductions or offsets. Therefore, it is all about balance.
When a country is carbon neutral, it can gain a competitive advantage through the acquisition of new market opportunities, branding, and the search for green business investments. In 2015, through the Paris Agreement, the United Nations pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by implementing nationally set targets. As a result, many countries today are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These greenhouse gas emissions cannot be stopped due to non-stop development projects and variations in day-to-day human lifestyles. Therefore, developing countries like Sri Lanka cannot wholly stop greenhouse gas emissions.
Green renewable projects, such as solar and hydro projects, capture or remove the atmospheric CO2 and act as a carbon sink. There are internationally accepted methodologies to calculate greenhouse gas removal on such projects. And also, we can calculate the greenhouse gases emission of individual persons or companies. When becoming carbon neutral, a company or a person can offset their unavoidable GHG emissions by purchasing carbon credits from eligible green projects. A carbon credit is a tradeable license or guarantee that gives the creditor the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide or the equivalent of another greenhouse gas. For individuals or companies that emit these greenhouse gases, carbon credit buyers can directly deal with carbon credit sellers to acquire carbon credit to become carbon neutral.
"CTrader" voluntary carbon trading mobile app will bring Sri Lankan green projects that offset the carbon in the environment and Sri Lankan users who are willing to neutralize their carbon emissions to one common application. Through this app, Sri Lankan users can voluntarily fund Sri Lankan green projects and contribute to climate neutrality. Furthermore, the user can calculate his vehicle's greenhouse gas emission and buy carbon credits equal to the calculated value for making climate neutrality by using this app. And also, green project owners can use this application to sell their carbon credits.

## Major Goals and Objectives
- Creating a common platform for both Sri Lankan Green Projects that sinks the carbon in the environment and users who willing to neutralize their GHG emissions.
- Encouraging the implementation of new green projects in Sri Lanka.
-	Encouraging people to think about climate neutrality.

## Scope of the Project
When it comes to GHG emissions, there are several ways of emitting GHGs because of humans' day-to-day activities. Household Electricity Consumption, Electricity Transmission & Distribution, Municipal Water Consumption, Diesel Generators, and vehicles will contribute to carbon emissions. However, we will only consider neutralizing the GHG emission on vehicles' usage through this application. The user can fund the green projects according to the monthly GHG emission of their vehicle by using this app. User, Admin, and Green project owner are the main three characters in this application. Users can create an account, calculate their GHG emissions, and add funds using this app. Green project owners can also create and update projects. Admin can monitor all the actions in this application.

## Main Characters in the Project 
User, Admin, and Green project owner are the main three characters in this "CTrader" voluntary carbon trading mobile app.

| Character | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Admin | Government or Private institute responsible for the environment or climate changes. |
| User | The people who are interested in neutralizing their vehicle's carbon emission by funding green projects. |
| Green Project Owner | A company or organization that has carbon offsets projects. These companies or organizations have carbon credits. |

## Software and Hardware Requirements
-	Standard Laptop. (Intel(R) core(TM) i5 | CPU 1.80 GHz | 8GB RAM)
-	Android Mobile Phone. (Android 5.0(LOLLIPOP) or high).
-	Internet Connection.
-	Visual Studio Code
-	Android Studio
-	Windows 10 Operating System

## Used Technologies 
-	React Native
-	Firebase

## Run the Project
First, you have to download the project or clone the project to your local machine.

### `git clone <url>`
  
In the project directory (Inside the CTrader or CTrader_Admin folders), you have to download the node modules. You can run:

### `npm install`

Then, you will need to start Metro. You can run:

### `npx react-native start`

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal inside your React Native project folder. Run the following:

### `npx react-native run-android`

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the CTrader voluntary carbon trading app running in your Android emulator shortly.
